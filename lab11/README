How to compile:
Type 'make' and an executable will be made called 'mychmod'
Type 'make clean' to remove 'mychmod'
You can also manually compile by typing 'gcc Jordan_Nicholas_Lab11.c -o mychmod'

Usage: ./mychmod -OPTION1 permission[s] [-OPTION2  permission[s]....] ... FILE1 [FILE2....]

Example: ./mychmod -u rw -G x -O rwx program.c
This example alters the following permissions for program.c:
1.) Adds read and write permissions for owner
2.) Removes execute permission for group
3.) Removes read, write and execute permissions for other users

Options:
1.) -u/U to change owner permissions
2.) -g/G to change group permissions
3.) -o/O to change other user permissions
- Lowercase adds permissions
- Uppercase removes permissions

Permissions:
1.) r = Read permissions
2.) w = Write permissions
3.) x = Executable permissions

Return Status Codes:
0 - successful execution of command
1 - command cannot be properly parsed
2 - file does not exist or you don't have permissions to change permissions
